<a>
<b> I WILL BE STORING ALL MY MINI-PROJECTS FOR NASM HERE </b>
</a>

## Why are you doing this?
<p>
  <a>I would like to get familiar with system programming as I believe it would enhance my skills in just general programming.</a>
  ** I believe that in order to become a better programmer you must understand how everything works under the hood. **  
  <a>I do in the future want to learn also how an Operating System works, but in order to do that I must learn some assembly.</a>
